* File Name : characterStrod.c

* Purpose : A value of type double is produced from the initial part of the string specified by the first
argument. The second argument is a pointer to a variable, ptr say , of type char* in which the function will store the address of the first character following the substring that was converted to the double value. If no string was found that could be converted to type double , the variable ptr will contain the address  passed as the first argument
